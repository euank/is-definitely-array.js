## Why does this exist?

As explained above, there are so many darn `isArray` libraries that someone out there *must* know something I don't.

So that you and I don't lose out and don't have to read all of their
implementations, this just implements an `isArray` function by checking if any
of the libraries say it is one.

### Uhhhhhhh..... Uhhhhhhh

Yes it's a joke. I know. It's okay.

#### But javascript.. But the standard library

But polyfills.

### I think I need an adult or a drink

I know someone with the initials "lm" who can help.

## Reading this readme was a mistake

Yes. So was this library.

# TODO

I think all the following would be funny:

* Benchmarks
* More functions
* More
* Longer readme
* Better readme
* Pull requests that seriously try to replace this with a simple check
* Ports to other languages
